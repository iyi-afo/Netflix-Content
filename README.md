The goal of this project is to uncover trends, clean the data, and extract meaningful insights about the types of content available on Netflix, the most popular genres, and patterns related to release dates and content durations.

The notebook systematically walks through data loading, cleaning, transformation, and key analysis steps to answer practical questions such as:

Which countries have the most Netflix content?

What are the most common genres?

How many shows fall under each rating category?

Which shows were added before the year 2000?

Which shows were directed by Rajkumar Hirani?

Which movies have durations over 100 minutes?
